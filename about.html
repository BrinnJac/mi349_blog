        <h2> About Jackson</h2>
        <p>My name is Jackson Brinn, and I'm 22. I'm a senior studying communications at MSU planning on graduating this year. When I was 11 years old, I attended military school in Kansas for seven years, and I lived at the school the majority of the year. In my freetime, I like to play games such as Minecraft and Rocket League. I'm really into Hip-Hop/Rap and R&amp;B, with country being my least favorite genre. There's just something about I can't seem to get behind. I was inspired to make this blog about Naruto because I've be urged to watch by quite a few friends. It's really good, if you couldn't tell already. So I really encourage you to view it; although, it is quite long.  </p>
