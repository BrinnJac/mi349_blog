      <p>Biography: Kakashi Hatake is a ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village and is the son of the White Fang. At five years old, Kakashi graduated from the Ninja Academy and became a Genin. He was an exceptional Ninja who excelled in all categories and, might I add, quite intelligent. At the age of 6, he became a Chuunin. He quickly became a squad leader, but during his time, his squad was ambushed by the ninja from the Hidden Rain. During this, Rin, his squad member, committed suicide by running into Kakashi purposely to avoid getting interrogated by the enemy, which changed him psychologically. Obito Uchiha, his other squad member, was caught in a trap and urged Kakashi to save himself. Before Kakashi left, Obito gave him a parting gift: one of his eyes. This eye had the ability of the Sharingan, a formidable visual jutsu exclusive to the Uchiha Clan. From this trauma, the darkness within him began to consume him. He joined the Foundation, a secret organization within the Hidden Leaf that worked directly with Lord Danzo. This organization required him to lose his sense of self and emotions, causing the darkness within to consume him more. He was a well-respected and feared ninja who partook in countless missions, executing enemy ninjas from other villages for the sake of the Hidden Leaf. The Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze took notice of Kakashi and thought his talents were wasted working in the shadows and placed him in the Anbu Black Ops. The AnBu is an organization under the direct control of the Hokage, which carries out surveillance, kill orders, and espionage missions. The Fourth Hokage did this so he could closely monitor Kakashi's well-being. Yet he became even more cold-hearted, still carrying the blame for Rin's and Obito's death. After serving for ten years, he was relieved of his position by the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi following Minato's death, sealing the Nine-Tails in his son, Naruto. He was assigned a new role as a Genin instructor. After failing countless students and sending them back to the academy, he came across three young Genin who changed his heart: Naruto, Sausake, and Sakura. Kakashi values teamwork and believes in battle; your first responsibility is to guarantee the safety of your companion, which those three displayed for each other even though they didn't get along. </p>

      <h3>Ataksuki</h3>
      <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://www.instagram.com/jackson_brinn/">Jackson Brinn</a></address>

      <p><img alt="Image of the entire Akatsuki organization" src="images/Akatsuki.jpg" /></p>
      <p>The Akatsuki is a prominent and enigmatic organization within the "Naruto" series, recognized for its role as a central antagonist group. Formed initially by Yahiko, Konan, and Nagato in the Hidden Rain Village, their original goal was to bring peace to their war-torn homeland. However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato, assuming the identity of Pain, steered the organization toward a darker path: capturing the tailed beasts to create a potent weapon. Each Akatsuki member wears their iconic long black cloak adorned with red clouds, and they are primarily rogue ninjas from their respective villages, denoted by slashed-out forehead protectors. The recruitment process is by invitation, with individuals chosen based on their exceptional abilities, power, and skills. Once admitted, members are paired with one another, leading to intriguing dynamics and conflicts within the group. The organization operates under the leadership of Pain, who wields the Rinnegan, a rare and powerful eye technique. The Akatsuki maintains a hidden lair within a vast cave, serving as their central base of operations. With a strict code of conduct prioritizing the organization's goals over personal ambitions, the Akatsuki's actions fuel the conflict and suspense in the "Naruto" series, revealing more profound layers of complexity and character development as the story unfolds.</p>
