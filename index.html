      <p>Biography: Kakashi Hatake is a ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village, and is the son of the White Fang. At the age of 5, Kakashi graduated from the Ninja Academy and became a Genin. He was an exceptional Ninja whom excelled in all categories, and might I add quite intelligent. At the age of 6, he became a Chuunin. He soon became a squad leader, but was ambushed by ninja of the Hidden Rain. During this Rin, his squad member, committed suicide by running into Kakashi, which changed him psychological. Obito Uchiha, his other squad member, was caught in a trap and urged Kakashi to save himself. Before Kakashi left Obito gave him a parting gift: one of his eyes. This eye had the ability of the Sharingan a formidable visual jutsu that is exclusive to the Uchiha Clan. From this trauma, he joined the Foundation, a secret organization that worked directly with Lord Danzo. This organization required him to lose his sense of self and emotions. He went on countless missions executing enemy ninja from other villages for the sake of the Hidden Leaf. The Fourth Hokage took notice of Kakashi and thought his talents were wasted working in the shadows, and placed him the AnBu Black Ops. The AnBu is an organization under the directly control of the Hokage which carried out surivellence, kill orders, and espionage missions. He became even more cold hearted still carrying the blame for Rin's and Obito's death. He was later relieved of position and assigned a new role as Genin instructor. After failing countless students and sending them back to the academy, he came across three young Genin who changed his heart: Naruto, Sausake, and Sakura. Kakashi values team work and believes in battle your first responsbility is to guarantee the safety of your companion, which those three displayed for each other even though they didn't get along. </p>

      <h3>Ataksuki</h3>

      <p><img alt="Image of the entire Akatsuki organization" src="images/Akatsuki.jpg" /></p>
      <p>The Akatsuki is a prominent and enigmatic organization within the "Naruto" series, recognized for its role as a central antagonist group. Formed initially by Yahiko, Konan, and Nagato in the Hidden Rain Village, their original goal was to bring peace to their war-torn homeland. However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato, assuming the identity of Pain, steered the organization toward a darker path: capturing the tailed beasts to create a potent weapon. Each Akatsuki member wears their iconic long black cloak adorned with red clouds, and they are primarily rogue ninja from their respective villages, denoted by slashed-out forehead protectors. The recruitment process is by invitation, with individuals chosen based on their exceptional abilities, power, and skills. Once admitted, members are paired with another, leading to intriguing dynamics and conflicts within the group. The organization operates under the leadership of Pain, who wields the Rinnegan, a rare and powerful eye technique. The Akatsuki maintains a hidden lair within a vast cave, serving as their central base of operations. With a strict code of conduct prioritizing the organization's goals over personal ambitions, the Akatsuki's actions fuel the conflict and suspense in the "Naruto" series, revealing deeper layers of complexity and character development as the story unfolds.</p>
